Secretary is an intelligent scheduling assistant who is able to generate duty rosters in a snap from customized XLSX (Microsoft Office Excel 2007 Document) templates.

## Get Started

It is recommended to download [the zip file](https://github.com/nczitzk/secretary/releases) containing the complete example and run the executable file to view the generated XLSX files. Or you can pull the source code and compile it yourself.

If everything goes well, two new XLSX files will be listed at where secretary locates. One is a feasible duty roster generated by secretary. The other one is a summary sheet of all staffs'available time periods, that clearly shows which staff is available for assignment to each shift specified.

## Workflow

1. To create a sheet for distributing to staffs in the following steps. It is recommended to use dropdowns in Excel to allow staffs to choose whether to accept the arrangement in that time period.

2. Now fill the time period identifiers in according to `__template_pattern` (`{{Mon:1}}` in the example) set in configurations JSON file (`settings.json` in the example) in the sheet you just created so that secretary can correctly understand the staff's timesheets. This also provides the template for generating the summary available timetable in the following steps. Check out [Templates](https://github.com/nczitzk/secretary/wiki/Templates).

3. To distribute available timetable sheets for staffs to fill out.

4. Next you need to create the template for the duty roster. Again, to fill the time period identifiers in the cells that need to be arranged by the secretary. Unlike the summary available timetable, the duty roster has only one staff's name in each cell. This means you can determine the maximum number of people per shift by limiting the number of cells per time period and even specify different positions for staffs on the same shift in the duty roster. Yes. the secretary will try to assign staff to different positions rather than repeatly assign the same staff to the same position.

5. Before executing the program, make sure the configurations in JSON file (`settings.json` in the example) have been correctly set. Check out [Configurations](https://github.com/nczitzk/secretary/wiki/Configurations).

6. Run secretary.
